# Welcome!
This branch is called the repository level branch because it belongs to the repository as a whole and not necessarily to any projects. It is abbreviated as "repo/root" because it stores stuff in the root, or top level of the repository.
This branch contains files that are associated with the repository as a whole, not any of the projects in particular.
This file is a readme / welcome mat to the repo level branch and files. It contains information about the repository as a whole.
Some repository documentation and notes are located in the google doc linked here:

A file that is supposed to be independent of history rewrites that is not in a repo level branch is:
README.md in remote head branch (currently master).
This file should always be in remote head regardless of history resets, and should move when remote head moves.
There is no special branch reserved for these kinds of files because there is only one instance of this type of file as of now (README.md).
All potential future instances of this type should be considered if they can be in the repository level branch and given a reference from the readme in master branch.
